= Performance benchmarks =
The benchmarks below are shown in different configurations:
  * _ro_ is with rounding and overflow detection enabled.
  * _nn_ is `-DFIXMATH_NO_OVERFLOW -DFIXMATH_NO_ROUNDING`, ie. both disabled.

The number after the configuration means the wordwidth setting, which does not affect accuracy but is selected to be suitable for the platform:
  * _64_ is default
  * _32_ is with `-DFIXMATH_NO_64BIT`
  * _08_ is with `-DFIXMATH_OPTIMIZE_8BIT`

The performance tests are performed on a quite small number of testcases, because of the memory needed to store correct answers. The average number may not be representative of the average value in a real application, but the minimum and maximum values likely are quite accurate.

== ARM Cortex M3 ==
Using simulator qemu-system-arm version 0.15.50 and compiler Sourcery G++ Lite 2011.03-42. The values are the _number of instructions executed_. Most instructions on the platform take 1 cycle to execute, with some taking 2 cycles.
